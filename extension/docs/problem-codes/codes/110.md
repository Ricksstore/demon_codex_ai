# IDL Problem Code `110` with alias `logical-and`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: info Warning Problem
This is a "problem" that gets reported to let users know how that behavior might not match what they expect.
:::

When IDL's compile options are set to `idl2`, `idl3`, or `logical_predicate`, it changes the way that logical operations are handled.

This warning let's you know that you should use `&&` instead of `and` with logical comparisons in if, case, or switch statements.

```idl
compile_opt idl2

if a and b then print, 'True!
   ; ^^^ warning appears here
```

To correct, use `&&` instead

```idl
compile_opt idl2

if a && b then print, 'True!
   ; ^^ no warning
```

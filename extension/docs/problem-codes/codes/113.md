# IDL Problem Code `113` with alias `logical-xor`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: info Warning Problem
This is a "problem" that gets reported to let users know how that behavior might not match what they expect.
:::

When IDL's compile options are set to `idl2`, `idl3`, or `logical_predicate`, it changes the way that logical operations are handled.

This warning let's you know that you may want to re-work your code to avoid using `xor` within the logical statement. This is not an error, however, and everything should function as expected if you are familiar with the operator.

```idl
compile_opt idl2

if a xor b then print, 'True!'
   ; ^^^ warning appears here
```

This tells IDL to use the latest version that is after version \"1.2.3\".\n\nNote: No spaces are allowed between the operator and the version number. Also, no spaces are allowed in the version string itself.\n\nIPM supports the following operators:\n\n- \"=\": equal (this is the default when no operator is supplied)\n- \">\": greater than\n- \"<\": less than\n- \">=\": greater than or equal to\n- \"<=\": less than or equal to\n\n---\n\nCombined Ranges\n\nA space between two basic ranges means both ranges must be satisfied. To use range 1 OR range 2, use  \"||\" between two ranges.\n\n- \">=1.2 <1.6\" means any version greater than or equal to 1.2 but also less than 1.6.\n- \">=1.5 || 1.3\" means any version greater than or equal to 1.5, but also allow version 1.3\n\n---\n\nMajor Ranges\n\nThe caret (^) comparison operator is for major level changes (i.e., the major version must be the same). This is useful when comparisons of versions as a major change is breaking.\n\n- \"^1.2.3\" means any version greater than or equal to 1.2.3, but less than 2.0.0 (>=1.2.3 <2.0.0)\n\n---\n\nMinor Ranges\n\nThe tilde (~) comparison operator is for patch level ranges, i.e., both the major and minor versions must be the same.\n\n- \"~1.2.3\" means any version greater than or equal to 1.2.3, but less than 1.3.0 (>=1.2.3 <1.3.0)",

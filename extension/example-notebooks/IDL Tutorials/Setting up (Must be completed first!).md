## Welcome to IDL guides!
These guides utilize **IDL notebooks** (`.idlnb`).  
To properly view and interact with them, you will need the **IDL extension** in VS Code.

### 1) Installing Visual Studio Code.
>If you already have Visual Studio Code installed please skip to step 2

Download VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/. and install to wherever you are comfortable with. VS Code is a free, lightweight text and code editor developed by Microsoft. The IDL notebooks extension utilizes its notebook interface for coding.

### 2) Installing the IDL for VSCode extension
- Launch Vscode on your computer.
- In Vscode, navigate to the **Extensions** tab in the "Activity Bar" on the left side of the screen. It looks like four squares.
</br> **OR** </br>
press ```Ctrl+Shift+x``` or ```Cmd+Shit+X``` to directly open the extensions view.
- At the top of the **Extensions** tab there should be a search bar. In that search bar search for "**IDL for VSCode**" and install.
- You may need to Reload Vscode after this step. To do so either press ```Ctrl+Shift+P``` or ```Cmd+Shift+P``` to Open the Command Palette. Then Type "Reload Window" and press Enter.
</br> **OR** </br> 
Restart the Vscode application.

After installing the extension you should the IDL flag ![IDL_ExtensionImage](./resources/Images/IDL_Extension.png) Somewhere on your Activity Bar.

If you see it, then you can now view and edit **IDL notebooks** (`.idlnb`) files!  
If you have an **IDL Installation**, now would be the time to hook it up.  
For help with this, please refer to **IDL for Beginners** → **01-Getting Started** → **01-Running IDL in Notebooks**.

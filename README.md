**Version 5.0 is here!** This release introduces major new features and improvements. Here are the highlights:

- **New native integration with IDL 9.2+** powered by the _IDL Machine_ for a faster, more responsive experience in VSCode

- **Initial GitHub Copilot integration** to let AI start IDL, run code, and automate common development tasks

- **First version of a web extension** allowing you to view IDL code and notebooks directly in the browser — lightweight for now, but a step toward full desktop/browser parity

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

---

An open-source extension which brings IDL (Interactive Data Language) to Visual Studio Code! This extension does _not_ include IDL, but you can download it from our website [here](https://portal.nv5geospatialsoftware.com/).

This extension includes:

- A full-featured IDL code editor, with variable type detection, auto complete, chromacoding, problem reporting, and code formatting

- Does not require IDL to be installed to write/edit code. IDL is only required when debugging/running code or using IDL Notebooks.

- An integrated debugger with breakpoints, or run command-line IDL within the VS Code terminal

- Native support IDL Notebooks with embedded graphics and save to PDF (this is from VSCode, does not require Python)

- Hover help contains the complete documentation for ENVI and IDL, including examples that you can open in IDL Notebooks.

- Create routine-definition documentation for routines within SAVE files or DLMs

- Support for internationalization

  - Submit a bug/feature for adding languages. Hopefully they are for a language that you speak, so you could also help with the translation :)

Check out our [official docs site](https://interactive-data-language.github.io/vscode-idl/) to learn more about these features and what else is included in the extension.

## IDL and ENVI Requirement

You do not need IDL installed to write code with this extension. If you are using IDL Notebooks, the debug sessions of IDL, or running IDL in a terminal window, you will need to have IDL installed on the same machine where VSCode is running.

While there are many versions of IDL out there, we test the extension against the two latest versions of IDL. As of right now, that would be IDL 9.1 and IDL 9.0. Any other version is use-at-your-own-risk and may not work (you need lists, hashes, and ordered hashes for it to function).

IDL Notebooks have specific version requirements for IDL and ENVI:

- For IDL, you'll need IDL 8.8.0 or newer (enforced, and checked, when notebooks start)

- For ENVI, you'll need ENVI 6.0 or ENVI 5.7. Any other version of ENVI is not guaranteed to work.

## Known Issues

- Not an issue, but structure definitions are _only_ found in procedures that end with "\_\_define" following IDL's standard. If you define structures anywhere else, they will not be detected and you'll see a error regarding unknown structures.

- By default, the language server that parses your IDL code is limited to about 1.5 million lines of code. If you notice that the extension is running out of memory (language server crashes), one workaround is to install "node.js" and ensure that it is on your system path.

  When the IDL extension starts, if it finds node.js on your path, it will automatically start the language server using node, which should remove this limitation. If you still see memory errors, then reach out to us on GitHub and let us know.

  To install node.js, get the latest v20 release from https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases.

- The debugger is back and has some improvements. However, this is still a pre-release version of the ability to interactively run IDL code. Here's a few important things to know:

  - Pausing is not supported on Windows, this will hopefully be resolved in the near future. Currently it kills the IDL process and is being worked on.

  - If you find reproduce cases where syntax errors are not appearing, or are not going away, please file a bug report.

  - If syntax errors are not going away then you can: reset IDL, restart IDL, stop and start IDL again and they will disappear.

  - You may occasionally see some text that is printed to the console when IDL is running, this is a known bug that happens for a few rare cases and can be ignored.

## Usage Metrics

The IDL extension for VSCode collects anonymous usage data on the extension. The goal of this information is to improve the overall experience, focus development on tools that users work with the most, and make sure our software can run on the average user's hardware.

> IDL for VSCode uses the VSCode root preference for telemetry (`telemetry.telemetryLevel`) as an indicator if we should send usage metrics or not.
>
> To disable reporting usage metrics for VSCode, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_disable-telemetry-reporting) for more information.

To learn more about what we collect and why, view our [USAGE_METRICS](./extension/docs/general/USAGE_METRICS.md) guide.

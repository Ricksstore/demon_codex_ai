export const EXECUTE_IDL_CODE_DESCRIPTION = `
Executes a string of one or more lines of IDL code separated with new line characters. 

There can be multiple lines of code which will be prepared, executed, and standard output will be returned along with a flag if we executed successfully or not..

You can provide an entire file's worth of code to run and this tool will manage the execution without a separate file needing to be written to disk.
